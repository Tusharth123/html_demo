      Narendra Modi, born on 17th September 1950 in Vadnagar, Gujarat, is one of
      India's most influential political leaders. Rising from humble beginnings
      as a tea seller, he joined the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) in his
      youth and later became a full-time worker for the Bharatiya Janata Party
      (BJP). His strong organizational skills and grassroots connection helped
      him rise through the ranks, eventually becoming the Chief Minister of
      Gujarat in 2001, a position he held until 2014.

      As Prime Minister since 2014, Modi has launched several major initiatives
      aimed at transforming India’s infrastructure and economy. Key programs
      like Digital India, Make in India, Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, and Ayushman
      Bharat have focused on modernization, cleanliness, health, and digital
      connectivity. His foreign policy approach has also strengthened India’s
      global presence, forging closer ties with major powers while advocating
      for self-reliance through the "Atmanirbhar Bharat" initiative.

      Modi is known for his charismatic oratory, disciplined lifestyle, and
      strong leadership style. While his tenure has been praised for development
      and decisive governance, it has also attracted criticism over issues like
      social polarization and press freedom. Despite differing opinions,
      Narendra Modi remains a central figure in contemporary Indian politics,
      shaping the nation’s trajectory in the 21st century.
